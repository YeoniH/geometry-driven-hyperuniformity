## About this folder

The STL geometry files are provided as supporting materials for publication [1] below, which explores evolving topological mechanical states in the continuum through vibration experiments and numerical analysis.
The text file contains the test data for the average response spectrum of the 2 $\times$ 2 Thomas-PP sample in the work.  
For any questions, please feel free to reach out to myself or my collaborator, Dr. [Can Nerse](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=D-5zkhAAAAAJ&hl=en): can.nerse@gmail.com
